My 2048 game project was to create a responsive and user-friendly
interface using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I designed the user interface with simplicity and elegance.
I've also done extensive testing to make sure the interface works flawlessly in all browsers.

Technologies used:
  - HTML5
  - SCSS
  - JS ES6
